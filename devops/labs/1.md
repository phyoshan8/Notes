# Day 1: Creating a Linux User with a Non-Interactive Shell

## 🏢 The Scenario

At **xFusionCorp Industries**, a backup agent tool requires a dedicated user account to run processes. To adhere to the **Principle of Least Privilege**, this user must be restricted from interactive login.

- **Objective:** Create a service account without shell access.
- **Key Concept:** [[Non-Interactive Shell]] (prevents command prompt access).

## 🛠 Implementation

To create a user with no login capabilities, use the `-s` (shell) flag pointing to `/sbin/nologin`.

```bash
# Replace <username> with mark, anita, or johndoe
sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin <username>
```
