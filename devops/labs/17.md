##Task
The Nautilus application development team has shared that they are planning to deploy one newly developed application on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC. The application uses PostgreSQL database, so as a pre-requisite we need to set up PostgreSQL database server as per requirements shared below:

PostgreSQL database server is already installed on the Nautilus database server.

a. Create a database user kodekloud_joy and set its password to TmPcZjtRQx.

b. Create a database kodekloud_db6 and grant full permissions to user kodekloud_joy on this database.

Note: Please do not try to restart PostgreSQL server service.
